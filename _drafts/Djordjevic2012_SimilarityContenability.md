# In a nutshell....
This paper attacks Lewisian theories of counterfactuals, suggesting their core issues lie in their notion of _absolute_ similarity.

Djordjevic also disucusses the relation between Lewis and Goodman and argues that the relation between these two theories is not as Lewis thought.

# 1. Lewis's and metalinguistic theory of counterfactuals.

After briefly reviewing Lewisian theory (1.1), Djordjevic offers a counterexample for Leiwsian theory (1.2).

# 2. Absolute Similarity

Djordjevic criticizes the absolute similarity, equipped to not only Lewis's but also any theory similar to it.

# Notes
The section 1 is a concise summary of Lewisian theory of counterfactuals. The sphere figures included!
