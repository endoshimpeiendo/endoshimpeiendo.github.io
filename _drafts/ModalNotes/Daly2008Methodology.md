Daly, Chris John. “The Methodology of Genuine Modal Realism.” Synthese 162, no. 1 (May 6, 2008): 37–52. https://doi.org/10.1007/s11229-007-9176-7.


Daly defends David Lewis's version of modal realism from a range of criticisms which attacks its methodology. In particular, Chihara and Cameron point out that Lewis commits to a common fallacy of begging the question. Moreover, Shalkowski finds vicious circle in Lewis. Daly counter-argues to them and claims that Lewis's methodology can be sound and their critics are just ignorant of Lewis's strategy.

Having quickly summarized Lewisian theory (sec. 2),
each section digests an objection and responses to it (sec. 3: Chihara et al.'s irrelevance objection + begging the question, 4: Shalkowski's version of the modal irrelevance, 5: Cameron's epistemological objection, 6: Cameron's epistemic circularity). The section 7 offers a new reading of Lewis's IBE.

Chihara (and Cameron following him) criticizes Lewis for his methodological error when he discusses the modal irrelevance and the modal knowledge objections.  Section 2 and 3 deal with this irrelevance objection. What is the irrelevance objection? Recall van Inwagen's original: "[Lewis] needs to face the problem of explaining what these things [i.e. Lewisian worlds] would have to do with modality if there were any of them." [van Inwagen 1985, p. 119] Lewis responds, as cited by both Chihara anc Cameron [Lewis 1986, p. 98]. Roughly, Lewis claims that he already did explain: "You might think that I have often explained what these things have to do with modality, for instance by saying that the modal operators are quantifiers over them." Chihara continues: "But this is just what was being disputed: the objector was claiming that modal operators cannot reasonably be taken to be quantifications over worlds, since these worlds are irrelevant to modality. So, from the point of view of his  disputers, Lewis was simply begging the question against his opponent .... Lewis responds to [the] objection from the perspective of one for whom the analysis is already beyond question."[Chihara 1998, p.95]

Daly argues that Chihara and Cameron fail to capture Lewis's strategy.
"Lewis does not attempt to argue that there is a plurality of worlds from the premise that there is a correspondence between worlds and modality. Nor does he attempt to argue in the converse direction. Instead, he argues for the conjunction often claims which are characteristics of genuine modal realism from the premise that conjunction achieves a degree of theoretical utility and economy which significantly offsets its ontological diseconomy" [p. 40]


## Inference to the best explanation
Lewis's methodology is often understood as an inference to the best explanation. An enemy of Lewis might accept that but would argue that Lewis adopts a "flawed model" of IBE. Let us suppose T provides the best explanation for a target phenomenon P. But this does not promise that according to the theory we currently hold T provides the best explanation of P. Hence, the opponent of Lewis argues that Lewis's strategy has nothing to do with the current debate.

Daly offers an alternative model to understand Lewis's IBE. The key idea is to consider our current belief as well.  "When we want to infer a theory as the best potential explanation of a phenomenon P, we evaluate each candidate theory in turn as a potential explanation of P. We carry out the evaluation by taking the conjunction of each candidate theory with our current belief set, and considering how good a potential explanation we would then have of P. Now it is likely that the conjunction of a given theory T with our current belief set is in consistent. So what we conjoin with T is some suitably revised version of our current belief set. We envisage such revisions in our belief set as would make it consistent with T, and, more generally, would make it provide the best overall potential explanation of P that T could provide. [...]"
