In another article with a more general title (notice its plural "realisms"), he offers a more digest version of his modal realism with overlap (MRO).

The author also wrote another interesting paper on modal metaphysics. This paper discusses distance and discreteness of space.

His monograph would interest not only anglo-speaking metaphysicians in so-called analytic tradition but also Heidegger readers. I am even thinking about organizing some reading group for this book, expecting some future collaboration with Heideggerians.

## Summary

In this paper, McDaniel suggests an alternative version of modal realism named modal realism with overlap, according to which objects can appear at more than one worlds. Its interesting consequences include: (i) ontological distinction between regions of spacetime and material objects (locus and things!) (ii) compositional pluralism: there are plural fundamental part-whole relations, and (iii) the modal version of endurantism. 

The story goes like this. In the first section "Problems for Modal Realism with Overlap" considers two versions of modal realism with overlap: MRO1 and MRO2. Unfortunately, each one turns out to have its problem. The next section "Ontological and Compositional Pluralism" offers a hybrid version of MRO1 and MRO2 to overcome their difficulties. Later on, beginning at the third section "The Account of Possible Worlds and Existence at a World", McDaniel discusses the consequences (i) - (iii) of his desired version of MRO. In the final section, McDaniel insists that MRO provides the philosophical resources to solve the well known puzzle of coincident objects.

### 1. Problems for Modal Realism with Overlap
McDaniel mentions with three motivations of him to suggest and defend a new version of modal realism: (i) Someone hates counterpart theory (ii) We often misunderstand all the modal realisms are of David Lewis's brand, and (iii) the modal analogue of three-dimensinoalism should deserve some attention (as three-dimensionalism in the metaphysics of duration deserves its attention).

The first version MRO1 is "either inconsistent with the intuitions that motivate it or flat-out internally inconsistent". [p. 138] The second version, on the other hand, leaves modality unanalyzed.

What characterizes MRO1 is that the relations of parthood and spatiotemporal relatedness are both two-place relations. Lewis clearly rejects this version because it entails that every object has its intrinsic properties essentially. Moreover, the two-place predicate of parthood implies mereological essentialism, according to which an object necessarily has its part.

According to the modifed version MRO2, the relations of parthood and spatiotemporal relatedness are rather understood as three-place relations: x is a part of y at w and x is spatiotemporally related to y at w. However, this modification causes a different problem of reduction. The concept of worlds appear in the explanation of being spatiotemporally related, which is supposed to explain what worlds are. Proper reduction fails!

### 2. Ontological and Compositional Pluralism
This section gives a hybrid version of MRO:

"(1) w is a possible world if and only if (i) w is a region of spacetime, (ii) every part of w is spatiotemporally related to every other part of w, (iii) no part of w is spatiotemporally related to anything that is no a part of w." [p. 147]

### 3. The Account of Possible Worlds and Existence at a World

Notice the following remark:
"[T]here is an obvious sense in which an object can be contained by a region of spacetime, i.e., be wholly present at that region, without being a part of that region. Likewise, an object can be contained by a world, i.e., exist at that world, without being a part of that world. "

### 4. MRO and Coincident Objects

This section demonstarates that McDaniel's brand of MRO solves the puzzle of coincident objects. Assuming two well-believed principles (Leibniz's law and mereological extensionality), it causes a paradox. But these two assumptions are not so obvious in both camps (with overlaps or with counterpart) of modal realism.
