The author's interest spreads between language and social phenomena (i.e. social ontology). On plurals, which is a model case of this paper, she wrote a (technical but introductory) article in a handbook.

# In a nutshell ....
Can semantics guide ontology? Her answer is: yes, but at most partially.
Considering her model case of plurals, Ritchie argues that there are many different but equally good alternatives for a semantics for a certain class of natural language. She also argues that even with a single semantics, we can extract multiple ontological commitments from the semantics. Hence, semantics cannot provide the final solution to the ontological issues.

## 1. Introduction
Ritchie names the three possible ways for semantics to determine ontology. That is:
(1) a semantic theory determines the ontological commitment, (2) an agent undertakes the ontological commitments once she believes a theory, and (3) given the truth semantic theory of the world, it determines what ontologically exist.

I do understand that (3) is weaker than it sounds because its precondition (supposing that we have the genuine theory of the world) is strong. However, I do not undderstand why the first one (1) is categorized the strongest according to Ritchie.

Her main argument is represent here. Why does not semantics work as having been expected since the Linguistic Turn? Her answer is: because there are many options as good as each other for the semantics.

Ritchie warns that her claim is not around indeterminism of meaning (like Kripkenstein) nor underdetermination of data (as many philosophers of sciences). Rather, she claims, her issue is close to indeterminism of reference in the context of incrutability argument (gavagai!).

## 2. Against descriptionism for Natural Language
Ritchie goes against two classical views: revisionary view and description view. The former (Frege, Tarski, Russell, Quine) says that natural language is just so messy that we should revise it into a more formal one. Ritchie does not argue this position into detail because this position asks us to see ontology guide semantics. Completely opposite.

The latter is discussed with a more attention. Descriptists, such as Davidson, Harman and Stanley, believe that our empirical research will take us to the true and genune metaphysical reality lying behind languages. FOr many, especially Davidson, the structure is of the first order predicate logic.

## 3. Adequacy and Ontological Revelation

This section first states her methodology according to which we should consider semantics seriously when we attempt questions in the form "Does theory T carry a commitment F?". The later part is a case study for plurals (like dogs or students. compared to singulars like dog or student).  

## 4. Unrelativized Ontological Commitments

This section supports a principle that provides "unrelativized, but possibly indeterminate, ontological commitments of a theory." [p. 3]

## 5. Concluding Remark
This remark returns to the postponed question on how different Ritchie's argument goes from inscrutability arguments on the reference (e.g. Quine's `gavagai') and more radical inscrutability arguments (such as Davidson 1979 and Putnam 1981).

The last concluding paragraph:
> Semantics has a place of prominence in metaontological discussions. Understanding the extent to which semantics might take priority in our inquiry informs our understanding of the relation between semantics and ontology. I have argued that, when semantic treatments are assessed prior to ontological considerations, ontological questions may not have determinate answers. Given this, semantics can at best serve as a partial guide to answering questions of ontology. If ontology is to be determinate, ontology can begin, but cannot end, in semantics.
