Cameron, Ross P. “On Characterizing the Presentism/Eternalism and Actualism/Possibilism Debates.” Analytic Philosophy 57, no. 2 (June 2016): 110–40. https://doi.org/10.1111/phib.12083.

This paper is meta-metaphysical -- examines what disputes (what position vs. what) we should consider. Cameron talks about debates on time and modality at the same time, taking some analogy widely believed.

This paper is hard to read for two reasons.
First, the paper is not organized in a more traditional style of Anglo-speaking philosophy -- no introduction nor abstract! Second, this paper is long. 30 pages.

His suggestion, stated in the third section, is that we should relocate the metaphysical question from what there are to where they are.

In the first section, Cameron shows that permanentalism does not cover the debate between presentism and eternalism because permanentalism is independent of these two positions. In the second section, Cameron offers its modal version. The modal counterpart of permanentalism is Williamson's necessitism, according to which necessarily everything exists necessariy. Necssitism is compatible with both actualism and possibilism. Cameron also takes some length to discuss the relating issue of domain inclusion.

The third section gives Cameron's own point. Cameron sugests that actualism / possibilism debate is better understood when we see that as "where things are" rather than "what there are". The third section is titled "The Need for Location". We need to think about location of entities when we talk about crucial metaphysical debates.

I am not following his argument in detail yet, but I think his idea of introducing location to tidy up the complicated argument. My master thesis features the concept of location but in a kind of first-order manner. It may be a huge plus if I can also argue that importing the concept of location works better in such a meta-metaphysical (methodological) level.
