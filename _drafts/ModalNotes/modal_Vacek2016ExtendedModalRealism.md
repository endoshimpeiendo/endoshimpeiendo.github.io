Vaceck supports Yagisawa's modal dimensinoalism (MD). MD is realism about metaphysical indices (such as times) that assign a certain metaphysical label to things (e.g. a temporal indice makes a thing temporal). The main reason for modal dimensionalsm is impossible worlds.

## 1 Introduction
The merit of dimensionalism compared to modal realism is impossible worlds, which have been employed in many areas of philosophy. "In particular, I will show how one can be a `quasi' modal realist and still have a consistent ontology of possible and impossible worlds." [pp. XX]

The remaining sections offer (i) comparison between modal dimensionalism and modal realism [sec. 2], (ii) counterarguments against modal dimensinoalism, and (iii) counter-counterarguments against (ii). The construction of this paper after the third section looks clumsy (chiefly due to the typesetting error of sectioning).

## 2 MD vs. MR

This section compares modal dimensionalism and modal realism. The last paragraph is a concise summary of modal dimensionalism:
"To sum up, MD presents a two categorical ontology: it posists concrete world stages and, in addition, metaphysical indices. The universe and its parts have spatial, temporal and modal dimensions as they extend in time, space and worlds. The universe and its parts have temporal, spatial and modal stages, and it is those stages that represents temporality, spatiality and, most importantly for our purposese, modality. One thing that MD has going for it is thus that the analogous theoretical roles of temporal, spatial and modal indices pave the way for a systematic and unified metaphysics of modality. "[p. XX]

Takashi Yagisawa's Modal dimensionalism claims that "worlds are defined as modal indices that aare (but do not exist) along the world's temporal and spatial indices." [p. XX] Notice Yagisawa's wording of reality , which is fundamental and monadic and existence, which is relative to domains. The actual world in modal realism is called the actual stage/slice of modal indice. Possible worlds are neither concrete nor abstract. Yagisawa leaves it open whether possible worlds are objects or not (see Yagisawa 2010 p. 179, fn. 7).

Vacek lists several important claims of modal dimensionalism. The first one says that dimensions are fundamental and primitive.
Modal dimensionalism has at least two division of entities: concrete individuals and metaphysical indices.

The second important fact is Yagisawa takes the analogy between space, time and modality seriously. As it does through spatial and temporal dimensions, our universe spreads through  modal dimension(s). Think a modal notion *actual* as something analogous to a temporal notion *now*.

Relating to this heavy analogy, another feature which differentiates modal dimensionalism from modal realism is that moddal dimensionalism accepts trans-world identification (cf. trans-temporal identification). Lewis is ok with the trans-temporal identification but rejects the modal version of that (see Lewis 1986 pp. 218-219).

Still another point is acceptance of impossible worlds, which Lewis refuses.


## 3. Some problems for MD

Vacek introduces a dilemma suggested by Jago (2012) and defends modal dimensionalism from it by begging to see the modal dimensionalism "as a whole, rather than the fragment used in the dilemma".

### 4 Possible worlds

Jago points out that Yagisawa's analysis of _de re_ modality violates well-accepted ideas on contingent things. Jago argues as follows. Any possible entity that might be F has a world stage that is F either necessarily or contingently. Both takes us to a contradiction.

## 5 Diagnoses

Here comes Vacek's reply to defend MD from Jago's dilemma. He discusses three points: (i) employ Yagisawa's modal tense, (ii) prohibit predication of any modal property of any world stage, and (iii) see a complext hierarchy of modal spaces.
