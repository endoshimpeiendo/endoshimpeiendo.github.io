Chapter 7 "Extensionalism"

## 7.1 Reduction.

Reduction has divided modal metaphysicians. Lewis's theory is reductionist while any actualist is non-reductionist. [p. 147]

Yagisawa mentions two objections towards Lewis. The first asks how a pile of concrete objects construct modal notions (cf. irrelevance objections) [p. 147]. The second is a more technical issue. His counterpart theory approves a funny consequence "It may disturb us that the translation of \forall x \Box \exist y (x = y) (everything actual necessarily exists)" comes out true even if something actual lacks a counterpart in some world." [Lewis 1983c: 31]. Lewis rejects Kaplan's suggestion saying `Out of the frying pan, into the fire'. Lewis discards such a sick language of quantified modal logic and use the language of counter-part theory directly [Lewis 1986: 12-13]. This counterpart theory talk is modal-free. So Lewis expels modal notions at "the fundamental level of metaphysical theorizing". [p. 149] Compared to these reductionists, actualists are non-reductionists.

Yagisawa takes both sides: "I am not entirely unsympathetic to the anti-reductionist sentiment of the actualists. At the same time, I am sympathetic to Lewis's zeal for seeking a theoretical analysis of the notion of possibility in more basic terms" [p. 149]. His "proposal is to offer the theoretical identification of possible worlds as metaphysical indices of the modal kind, while not offering any theoretical analysis of what it is for a metaphysical index to be of the modal kind, as opposed to the temporal kind or the spatial kind. Thus I am a soft reductionist The notion of a possiblke world is not primitive but the notion of a modal index is. More precisely, the _modal_ part of the notion of a modal index is primitive" [p. 150]. His reduction goes to the next step, but terminates there. His aim is rather to show a metaphysical view that modal facts stand real and objective (as much as temporal and spatial facts do).

## 7.2 Soft reduction

Yagisawa takes a middle between Lewisian theory and actualism with respect to how reductive they are. Notice Yagisawa here again relies on an analogy between time and modality.ã€€He is also a soft reductionist with respect to time. From Yagisawa's perspective, the early Lewis's hard reduction is read as a theory which sees possible worlds as metaphysical indices --better, individuals -- of the the spatio-temporal kind. The "irrelevant" type of charges such as  Skyrms and van Inwagen attack this point of Lewis.  

## 7.3 Possibility

A possible world is a kind of world. The question is what makes a world a possible world. The first observation to reach the answer is that possibility is not a property of a single world but a relation among different worlds. (Think about a definition of possibility in Kripke semantics.)

We may have different variety of possibility, based on the kind of laws K. "[A] world w_1 is accessible from a world w_2 if and only if all laws of kind K true at w_2 are true at w_1." Concering this law-based picture, among other three points, Yagisawa argues against the unrestricted (i.e. absolute) necessity for two reasons. First, we do not need such absolute thing. The more important reason is that "logical, conceptual, and metaphysical necessities are not absolutely unrestricted." I am being too lazy to follow his detailed argument given in p. 156. This point has something to do with his argument of impossible worlds, given in chapter 8.

## 7.4 Intensional entities: preliminaries
"I am a soft reductionist concerning modality, but when it comes to reductions of intensinoal objects, such as propositions, properties, and relations, I am a reductionist of a less soft variety." [p. 157]
This attitudes follows Lewis, according to whom we should believe his modal realism because it offers a nice reduction of these intensional concepts. Yagisawa refutes Plantinga's worry on Lewis's project. Yagisawa demonstrates his metaphyical theory of propositions.

We consider the following scheme.  
(1) The proposition that P is thus-and-so.
More particularly, think the following:
(4) The proposition that snow is white is true.
Upon them, the questions in this section ask:
(*) What is the mechanism underlying the determination of the _designatum_ of the subject term "the proposition that snow is white' in (4)?", and, relating to (*),
(#) What is the logical structure of (4)?

In the later four parts, Yagisawa discusses that-clauses. I am not fully following the connection between these technical topics and the earlier parts of this chapter (or even the entire project of this book).
